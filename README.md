# Electoral Analysis and Visualization: Understanding Seat Distribution by Margin-of-Votes Classification
## Background
This data science project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization of seat distribution in electoral systems based on margin-of-votes classification in two Malaysian general elections, namely General Election 14 and General Election 15. The project utilizes data scraping, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques to gain insights into how different alliances perform in elections and how seats are distributed among them based on voting margins.
## Motivation

This project is to gain a deeper understanding of electoral dynamics and provide valuable insights into the political landscape. By analyzing the seat distribution patterns, we can identify trends, assess the strength of alliances, and evaluate the competitiveness of electoral contests. This information can be valuable for political analysts, policymakers, and individuals interested in understanding the dynamics of elections and their outcomes.


## Methodology
This data science project focuses on analyzing the results of General Election 14 and 15. The project involves several key steps, including data extraction, data preparation, data analysis, and data visualization.
### Data Extraction
In the data extraction phase, web scraping techniques are employed to gather the election results data from Wikipedia. BeautifulSoup, a Python library, is utilized to parse the HTML structure of the Wikipedia pages and extract the required information. The use of Wikipedia is advantageous as it provides structured data in tabular format, making the data extraction process more efficient.
### Data Preparation
Once the data is extracted, it undergoes a data preparation phase. This involves organizing the data and ensuring consistency by removing any inconsistencies or symbols. The Pandas package in Python is employed for data manipulation and transformation, enabling the creation of a comprehensive table that includes the election results for each parliament session for General Election 14 and 15.
### Data Analysis
The data analysis phase focuses on calculating the performance of each alliance based on the election results. The seat distribution across alliances is determined, allowing for insights into the distribution of parliamentary seats. Additionally, the margin of votes is calculated, providing an understanding of the voting margins for each alliance. This information serves as the basis for further classification of the parliament seats according to their margin.
### Data Visualization
Data visualization plays a crucial role in this project, employing libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy. Various visualization techniques, including histograms, pie charts, and swarm plots, are utilized to effectively represent the seat distribution for each alliance in both General Election 14 and 15. These visualizations aid in understanding the patterns, trends, and disparities in the election results.

## Results
